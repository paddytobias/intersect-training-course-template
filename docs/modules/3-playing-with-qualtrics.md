In this module, we're going to give you sometime (roughly about half an hour) to learn by doing. That is, we want you to create your own survey from scratch... based on a hypothetical scenario.

First let's explore the various question types that Qualtrics supports

## Question types

- Refer here https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/editing-questions/question-types-guide/question-types-overview/

## Create your own
### Survey
>20 minutes {: .inset}

- Decide on a survey scenario. If you need some inspiration, we have [a few options](#scenarios) to choose from. Otherwise just make one up!
- Create questions using the **Survey Editor**
- Modify question types. Don't be afraid to get creative. Try and explore all of the question types in your survey. Think about the question and what answers you want to get.
  -  If you've chosen non-free text question types, then enter in the valid responses.

Questions to ask:
- _What question type would best cater for this?_

### Preview the survey
>10 minutes {: .inset}

- Once you have 6 questions or so, stop there and preview the survey.
- Undertake the survey yourself and make sure it is operating the way you want.
- Tinker with the survey if need be.
- This might take a few iterations

Questions to ask:
- _Is it working the way you want?_

### Distribute the survey and test
>10 minutes {: .inset}

- For now, let's not get too caught up in the Look & Feel of the survey. Find a partner in the room to whom you can distribute the survey. Exchange surveys and test how they have done it.

**Popular music**

**Data entry for science experiments**

**Language and culture**

By now you should start to be understanding the basic survey building features of Qualtrics. Qualtrics is a very powerful system and we are only just scratching the surface, but understanding how Qualtrics builds surveys will fast track your use of the tool.

## Next
In the next module we're going to work together on a pre-built survey.
